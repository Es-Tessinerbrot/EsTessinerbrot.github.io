            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I like automating stuff with Powershell and creating GUI's to make life easier.
                I've made various Forms with PHP and HTML, MSSQL/MySQL, CSS, a bit of Javascirpt and a pinch of Jquery.
                Occasionally, I like to dabble in other things like VB.NET, Python and even things like FreeCAD and more
