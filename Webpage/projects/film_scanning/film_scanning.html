    <h1>35mm Film digitizing</h1>

    <p>
        Ever since shooting Film, ive wanted to be able to scan my negatives myself.<br>
        Scanning them myself has many advantages, for example beeing able to set how the colors look or fixing white-balance and many more things <br> 
        which you couldn't do as good when getting your scans back as a jpg from a lab.

    <h2>Equipment</h2>

    <h3>Scanning rig</h3>
    <p>
        To digitize my 35mm Film ive built a little contraption to scan Film with my DSLR. <br>
        The first thing i needed was some type of holder for the film.<br>
        So i looked around for some holder for film on thingiverse.<br>
        i found this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4379458">rig</a> here, which i quite liked.

    <h3>Lens</h3>
    <p>
        In terms of lens choice, i went with a nikon 55mm AI-s f3.5. <br>

    <h3>Reproduction ratio</h3>

    <p>
        The lens is great for macro use already, but a reproduction ratio of 1:1, fully covers the full-frame sensor of a full frame sensor like my nikon D750.<br>
        To calculate the reproduction ratio, i used this calculator <a target="_blank" href="https://monochrome.sutic.nu/2018/05/24/extension-tube-calculator.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now i knew which extension tube length i needed. But to find a set of extension tubes that add up to exactly 48mm proved to be quite the challenge.<br>
        So instead of buying a set of extension tube, i bought macro bellows off ebay. Theese can be set to any length you desire.

    <h3>Light source</h3>
    <p>
        As a light source, i wanted to use my old mobile phone. <br>
        I had the phone holder piece from a selfie stick laying around so i used that as a holder. Since it has a 1/4"-20 thread nut in the bottom, it can be used to mount it to a tripod.<br>

    <h2>Scanning</h2>

    <p>
        To scan the negatives, i followed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/scanning-without-scanner-digitizing-your-film-dslr">this</a> 
        guide from B&H <br>
        With the help of the article, i did my first attempts at scanning film: <br>
